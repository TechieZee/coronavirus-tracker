# coronavirus-tracker
A Spring Boot Application that tracks coronavirus cases around the world.
Deployed at: https://coronavirus-tracking-project.herokuapp.com/



NOTE: The daily coronavirus cases data is fetched from a github repository. By no means I endorse that or know whether it is up to the mark. This project I have made purely fro practice purpose.
